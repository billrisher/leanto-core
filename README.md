  LeanTo - Core Library
  <br>
</h1>

<h2 align="center">The platform-agnostic data generator for projects on a timeline.</h4>
<h4 align="center">This library contains all of the infrastructure necessary to connect to your desired database, configure the data that you wish to generate and to generate default generation constraints.</h4>

LeanTo is a funky little Open Core project that seeks to fake rows in your database to test your API implementation.

Steps:

1. Connect to db
2. give the name of the table that you wish to fake
3. ???
4. Profit!

LeanTo is meant to be extendable and platform-agnostic. The code is as unopinionated as possible.
